## N-Triples and Turtle Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

This plist file is simply a version of [dozed's cleanup of the N3 Textmate Bundle](https://github.com/dozed/n3-tmbundle/commit/36989068b7896a1738ddb2fa881acda543600eeb) with (in my opinion) better choices for scope colours than the original. I might add more highlighting rules in future if they become useful.

## Usage

Create a new directory, `N3` in your `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User` folder. Place the `n3.tmLanguage` file inside and re-start Sublime. 

## Licence

I do not claim to own this, just carrying the torch for a useful tool. Credit to [Tom Morris](https://github.com/tommorris/n3-tmbundle) for first rescuing it from development hell; I'm only after syntax highlighting, but if you'd like some tab-autocomplete functionality as well, then I strongly recommend checking out the N3 plugin at that link.
